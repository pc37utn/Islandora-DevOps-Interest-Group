   * [Slack?](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/islandora/uys8TiwRX1w) 
   * Looking for a new Co-convener (Thanks again, Mark Jordan for all of your service!!)
   * New business is a call by Gavin for proposals regarding how to formally document the takeaways from these conversations. This format for the meetings appears to be working to share ideas and experience, but we would like to see these topics fleshed out. Proposed Action: translate the notes from these meetings into GitHub Issues on this repo. Tickets could be discussed and/or assigned within the meetings. The original scope of this group was pretty ambitious, this can help us refine discussions into action items.
4. New business
   * Review [Github issue queue](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-DevOps-Interest-Group/issues)
